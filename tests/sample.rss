Illinois electric vehicle startup Rivian built the world’s first fully-electric production pickup, and car journalists can’t stop gushing about it. They also have a huge Amazon contract, and they’re worth more money than the Ford Motor Company. … HOW?! Who are these guys? Where did they come from? Do they actually have a chance at snatching Tesla’s EV crown? And what the crap is a lawn mower turn? Join host James Pumphrey to find out: What’s the deal with Rivian?!

There's a facinating science behind the materials that manufacturers choose for each brake pad. Today on B2B we'll learn the reasoning behind these choices, and learn about how these materials are engineered as we explore Wilwood's fabrication facility. We're about to show you why you should be getting as excited about your brakes as you are about that fancy new turbo you just spent your last paycheck on.

Paul Walker didn’t just play a laid back SoCal car guy in The Fast And The Furious movies, he was a laid back SoCal car guy IRL. The role of Brian O’Conner fit him like a glove, so it’s no wonder it became the defining role of his career. But there was more to Paul Walker than fast cars, explosive action, and cheesy lines—a lot more. Join host James Pumphrey as he gets you Up To Speed on the late, great Paul Walker!

Thanks to our friend Scott Mansell at Driver61 for sharing his time and knowledge for this episode. Subscribe to his channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/Driver61 


Formula 1 wrecks like the one at Monza – where Verstappen did a burnout on Hamilton’s head – cost championship points and cold, hard cash. In 2021, those are both more precious than ever. When a big accident happens, that sends teams looking through their couches for change, but also wondering who should pick up the bill. So today, we’re gonna look at the high cost of F1 wrecks, figure out why they’re so expensive, and with special guest Scott Mansell of Driver 61, find out why they happen in the first place.

Can a Formula 1 driver really be the greatest athlete of all time? YES, and his name is Lewis Hamilton! But there’s more to that GOAT status than his astonishing SEVEN Championship wins. He’s a working class person of color in a sport long-dominated by rich white dudes, the first black F1 champ in history, and a just plain nice guy. Lewis Hamilton almost single-handedly saved Formula 1 from death by boredom. But how did he get to the top from such humble beginnings? Who helped him become the inspiration he is today? And did you know F1 drivers lose 9 POUNDS OF SWEAT during a race? Find out all this and more with host James Pumphrey as he gets you Up To Speed on The Greatest Athlete Of All Time, Lewis Hamilton!
 
Big ups to the one and only Zach Redpath for the edit. Zach was the throbbing visual soul of Donut for years, and he just busted out to explore the world. We ain’t mad about it. Godspeed, you beautiful maniac!

The Tesla Plaid is one of the fastest production EVs ever made and if you wanna beat it in an EV only race, you got two options: You could cheat on a technicality, or you could spend $2.4M dollars on a Rimac Nevera, the only production EV that’s faster. But what if there’s another way? A third option. Instead of buying a car to beat the Plaid, what if you built your own EV – and you did it on the cheap? Homemade EVs have been running faster 1/4-mile times than the Plaid for years, and many of those cost far less to build. So, there you go: the answer is “built not bought!” What’s the catch? Let’s find out!

Ford Mustang. Dodge Challenger. Toyota Tacoma. Some car names are so good, you can't imagine them being anything else. But sometimes, cars get dumb names. I'm talking REALLY dumb (Nissan Rouge anybody?). So how does that happen? We'll show you how cars get named, both good and bad.

When videogame developer Kazunori Yamauchi first pitched Gran Turismo, Sony said no. A few years later it became the best-selling title in the Playstation catalog, inspired followers like Forza, Dirt, and Project Car, and motivated genre giants like Mario Kart and Need For Speed to bring their A-game. How did this happen? What makes Gran Turismo so revolutionary? And what does the future hold for the world’s favorite racing game? Join host James Pumphrey as he finds out how Gran Turismo changed gaming forever.
