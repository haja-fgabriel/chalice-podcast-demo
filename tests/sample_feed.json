Check out their channel! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNa6darq0bmZ6kLtsliiWiA\n\nThe Tesla Plaid is one of the fastest production EVs ever made and if you wanna beat it in an EV only race, you got two options: You could cheat on a technicality, or you could spend $2.4M dollars on a Rimac Nevera, the only production EV that\u2019s faster. But what if there\u2019s another way? A third option. Instead of buying a car to beat the Plaid, what if you built your own EV \u2013 and you did it on the cheap? Homemade EVs have been running faster 1/4-mile times than the Plaid for years, and many of those cost far less to build. So, there you go: the answer is \u201cbuilt not bought!\u201d What\u2019s the catch?
